user Data
---------
-- once EC2 instance created, aws will run userdata script.

Disadvantages:
    - we have to login inside instance and check logs.
    - once userdata is changed, AWS will not update EC2 (delete EC2 & Create Again)

Remote Provisioner 
-----------------
Execute Scripts inside Remote Servers (with help of null_resource)
Note: null_resource will not Create any resource (it will used by Provisioner's)

Create Instance First
Connect to Server using null_resource and remote_exec
copy script into instance
